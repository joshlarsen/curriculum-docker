        Let's pretend its your first day on a new job as a developer. What's on of the first things you're going to want to do (after you figure out where the bathroom is?).

        If you're like me, it's get a good testing environment up and running so that you can begin working on the code.

        Docker lets you do this with only one command, if the project is set up correctly.

        Lucky for you, we set up a project so you can learn to do just this. Follow the steps below to get up and running with Docker fast.
      steps:
        - description: |
            Run `docker ps` to see what is running. Unless you've been using docker separately, the only running container should be the learning container you're working in.
          id: docker-demo-ps
          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-ps
              id: docker-demo-ps-verification
              success-message: "You ran `ps` correctly. Let's run some containers to make it less empty."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't run the command yet."
        - description: |
            We've already downloaded the code and project for you. `cd` into the `/swarm-microservice-demo-v1/` directory.
          id: docker-demo-cd
        - description: |
            Go ahead and take a peak at the code: you can see it's written in several languages and frameworks. In the top-level directory is a `compose.yml` file. This is the file that tells Docker how to run this code locally. 

            To run the code in a docker container, type `docker-compose up -d` in the directory with the compose file. 

            You'll want to make sure to include the `-d` or you won't be able to use your command line while the containers are running!
          id: docker-demo-compose-up-lab
          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-ps
              id: docker-demo-compose-up-lab-verification
              success-message: "Good work, it looks like the code is now running on your computer in a container. Click **next** to move on."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't run `docker-compose up -d` yet."
        - description: |
            Run `docker ps` again to see the new containers that are now running.
          id: docker-demo-ps-2

      title: Playing with the container.
      id: docker-demo-compose-down

        So now that the code is running in a container, what can you do with it?

        The first and probably most useful thing is that you can use the app. Type `localhost:8080` in your browser's URL bar, and you should see the app working. Go ahead and play around with it, test it out.

        The way we have our compose file set up, while all the dependencies and code are running in the container, the code itself is still hosted on your local machine (through what's called a mounted volume). That means that you can change the code locally and the container will automatically update with those changes. This makes making changes to the code and testing those changes incredibly fast.
      steps:
        - description: |
            In the `/swarm-microservice-demo-v1/web-vote/app/templates/` folder, change the `index.html` file. Add some text to the `div` with the `id="hostname"` attribute. Then refresh your web browser. The change should show up!
          id: docker-demo-code-edit
        - description: |
            OK, now that your changes are working, you're done running the code locally. You can free up resources on your machine by spinning down the images used to run the code. Run `docker-compose down` to spin them down gracefully.
          id: docker-demo-compose-down-lab
          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-ps
              id: docker-demo-compose-down-lab-verification
              success-message: "Great, all the images have spun down. Run a `docker ps` to check it out yourself. Congrats, you completed the course!"
              failure-message: "It looks like the project is still running."
