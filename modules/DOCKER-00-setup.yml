      introduction: |
        In this course, you'll learn the basics of using Docker on a day-to-day basis, as well as how to set up your own project to use Docker (aka, how to "dockerize" it).

        You'll do this by working on a real web app inside a Docker container. We'll watch you do the work, and give you feedback when you've made mistakes and let you know when you've finished a task and it's safe to move on.

        The course is broken into two parts. In the first, you'll learn about why Docker is so powerful, and what the process for using it day to day in your development routine should be. In the second part, we'll walk you through the steps of dockerizing an app and ensuring you can get it up and running on any computer in just a few minutes.

        Before we start, we need to make sure you have Docker installed properly. Walk through the steps below, and once the last step has turend green you're ready to hit "next" and move on to the first part of the course.
      steps:
        - description: |
            Download and install Docker for Mac if you haven't already.

            Open the terminal. `CMD-space` then typing `terminal` should bring it up. If you've never used the terminal before, this course might be a bit advanced for you.

        - description: |
            Run the learning container by copy-pasting this script into the terminal: `docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock learning /bin/bash`. The command prompt will change once it's up and running to look like `root@488eed61e8e9:/#` once it's completed.

            You'll do all your work inside this learning container, pretending its your everday dev environment. This way we can see what work you're doing locally and give you feedback on it.

            Once the container is up and running, log in by typing `docker login` and entering your DockerID and password. Once you're logged in, you can move on.

          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-login
              id: docker-setup-login
              success-message: "We're reading you loud and clear! Click 'next' to move on, or try out the following optional commands."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't logged into the container yet. The course validations will not work until you do."

            Run `docker --version` to see what version of Docker is running.
          id: docker-setup-version
        - description: |
            Run `docker run hello-world`. Read the text that it outputs to learn how Docker runs an image.
