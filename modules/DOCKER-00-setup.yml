      title: Running a Docker Project
      id: docker-setup
      presenter-script: placeholder
      introduction: |
        In this course, you'll learn the basics of using Docker on a day-to-day basis, as well as how to set up your own project to use Docker (aka, how to "dockerize" it).

        You'll do this by working on a real web app inside a Docker container. We'll watch you do the work, and give you feedback when you've made mistakes and let you know when you've finished a task and it's safe to move on.

        The course is broken into two parts. In the first, you'll learn about why Docker is so powerful, and what the process for using it day to day in your development routine should be. In the second part, we'll walk you through the steps of dockerizing an app and ensuring you can get it up and running on any computer in just a few minutes.

        Before we start, we need to make sure you have Docker installed properly. Walk through the steps below, and once the last step has turend green you're ready to hit "next" and move on to the first part of the course.
      steps:

            Download and install <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/" target="_blank">Docker for Mac</a> if you haven't already. Make sure it's running.

            Open the terminal. `CMD-space` then typing `terminal` should bring it up. If you've never used the terminal before, this course might be a bit advanced for you.

            Let's try a few simple Docker commands. Run `docker --version` to see what version of Docker is running. If you get an error, then you probably haven't installed Docker and you should do that above!

        - description: |
            Run `docker run hello-world`. Read the text that it outputs to learn how Docker runs an image. If you get an error telling you the Deamon isn't working, then Docker isn't running, and you need to start the Docker for Mac application.

            We're going to do most of the work in this course inside a container that will act as your dev environment.

            Run the learning container by copy-pasting this script into the terminal: `docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock learning /bin/bash`. 

            The command prompt will change once it's up and running to look like `root@488eed61e8e9:/#` once it's completed.

            Doing work in this container will ensure than we can give you feedback on the work you've done!

            Once the container is up and running, log in by typing `docker login` and entering your DockerID and password. Once you're logged in, you can move on.
          id: docker-setup-login
          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-login
              id: docker-setup-login
              success-message: "We're reading you loud and clear! Click 'next' to move on, or try out the following optional commands."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't logged into the container yet. The course validations will not work until you do."
