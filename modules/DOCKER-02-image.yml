      title: "Dockerizing Your Project: Docker Images"
      image: blank.png
      presenter-script: |
        To get the benefits of Docker for your own project, you'll need to "Dockerize" that project.

        For most small code bases, this is pretty simple. You write a file that defines all the dependancies that your code needs to run, and then you use `docker build` to build an image that you can run from any computer. 

        The food truck app you worked with in the last lesson was already dockerized. Below, we're going to take you through the steps fo dockerizing yourself from scratch.

        In this lesson, we're going to be referencing the Docker docs a lot. The Docs are a great place to learn from, and include a lot of in-depth information on the way Docker works. We want to teach you not just about Docker, but also how to get information about Docker yourself in the future. 

        ## How Docker Works

        The Dockerfile is a plaintext file that defines a Docker image, which once built can then be run in a Docker conatiner on any computer.

        So to Dockerize an app, first you have to write the Dockerfile for that app. The Dockerfile contains all the information that Docker needs to know to run the app: where the code is contained on your local computer, what OS it runs on, what dependancies it has, and what commands should be run at start-up.

        Once you write the Dockerfile, you run `docker build` on that file, and the Docker daemon takes the information from the Dockerfile and creates an image from it. This Docker image is a binary file containing the OS and program data that can be transfered to any computer, and run on that computer using Docker inside a container.

        It's easy to confuse images and containers, because an image always runs in one container, and one container can only run a single image. Think of the image as the data necessary to run a container.

        A Dockerfile is a plaintext file named simply `Dockerfile`â€”there's no extension. 

        Inside the file is a series of comments and commands, in this format:

            # comment
            COMMAND arguments

        While the file is not case-sensative, it's recommended to write all commands in ALL CAPS to make the file easier to read.

        The commands are interpreted by the Docker Daemon when you call `docker build`, and are executed in order to set up the Image.

        ### The FROM Command

        The Dockerfile must start with the `FROM` command. Images are created in layers, which means you can use an Image as the base image for your own. The `FROM` command defines what your base layer will be. As arguments, it takes the name of the image. This name can be extended with the Docker Hub Username of the maintainer of the image, and the version of the image, in the format `username/imagename:version`. For instance:

            FROM python:3.5

        This command will build an image from the 3.5 version of the official Python image.

            FROM prakhar1989/catnip

        This command takes the most recent version of the Image `catnip` from the user `prakhar1989`.

        ### The RUN Command

        Perhaps the most common command is the `RUN` command. `RUN` is used to build up the Image you're creating. For each `RUN` command, Docker will run the command then create a new layer of the image. This way you can roll back your image to previous states easily.

        The `RUN` command is largely used to install necessary components onto your new Image. So you'll see a lot of `apt-get` commands.

        The syntax for a `RUN` instruction is to place the full text of the shell command after the `RUN`:

            RUN apt-get install -y curl

            RUN mkdir /user/local/foo

        This will create an Image with curl installed, then use that Image to create an image and create a new image from it with a /user/local/foo folder.

        This will automatically run in the `/bin/sh` shell. If you'd like to define a different shell, then the syntax is:

            RUN /bin/bash -c 'mkdir /user/local/foo'

        ### MAINTAINER

        A command that takes a name and email of the person who maintains the Image.

            MAINTAINER Adrian M Ryan <adrian.ryan@docker.com>

        ### EXPOSE

        The `EXPOSE` command opens ports in your Image so that it can speak to the outside world. The following tells the Image to listen at port 4000:

            EXPOSE 4000

        ### ADD

        Adds files and directories from the current directory into the container. 

            ADD /junk /usr/junk

        If there is an /junk directory inside the directory with the Dockerfile in it, this will add all the files and folders from that directory into the /usr/junk folder in the new container.

        ### WORKDIR

        This sets the directory that all the following RUN, CMD, ADD, and other commands will run in.

            WORKDIR /usr/junk

        ### CMD

        The final really important command is `CMD`. 

        `CMD` defines the commands that will run on the Image at start-up. Unlike a `RUN`, this does not create a new layer for the Image, but simply runs the command.

        There can only be one `CMD` per a Dockerfile/Image. If you need to run multiple commands, the best way to do that is to have the `CMD` run a script.

        `CMD` requires that you tell it where to run the command, unlike `RUN`. So example `CMD` commands would be:

            CMD ["python", "./app.py"]

            CMD ["/bin/bash", "echo", "Hello World"]

        ### Comments

        If a line begins with a `#`, then all the following text on that line will be ignored by the build command. This is a handy way to document what the purpose of your Dockerfile commands are so that you can more easily troubleshoot later.

      title: Writing a Dockerfile
      id: docker-image
      presenter-script: placeholder
      introduction: |
        We're going to use the same code as the last project, but this time write the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files ourselves. 
      steps:
        - description: |
            First, let's remove the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files. We've already set up a branch for you without these files, so just type `git checkout undockerized` into the terminal. If at any point you want to see the files again as a reference, `git checkout master` will bring them back. 
          id: docker-image-branching
        - description: |
            Now it's time to write the Dockerfile. Create a text file called simply `Dockerfile` in the top-level directory of your codebase (you can do this by typing `touch Dockerfile` in the terminal).
          id: docker-image-dockerfile-create
        - description: |
            Open the Dockerfile in a text editor. We recommend nano. `nano Dockerfile` in the terminal. 

            You'll start by adding the `FROM` command line. It should look like this:
            
                FROM ubuntu:14.04
          id: docker-image-dockerfile-from
        - description: |
            Now, on each new line you'll want to write a command that completes one of the following bullet points, in this order. Remember, if you get stuck on any of them you can check the answer by going to the master branch with `git checkout master` and looking at the Dockerfile there.

            \* Add your DockerID as the maintainer

            \* Run `apt-get -yqg update`

            \* Using apt-get, install python-pip and python-dev

            \* Using apt-get, install nodejs and npm

            \* Link nodejs and node with the `ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node` command

            \* Add flaskapp to the directory /opt/flaskapp

            \* Set /opt/flaskapp to be the working directory

            \* Run `npm install`

            \* Run `npm run build`

            \* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

            \* Expose port 5000

            \* On start-up, run the command `python ./app.py`
