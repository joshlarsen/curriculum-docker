        ## Installing Docker for Mac

        Docker for Mac makes it easy to get started using Docker on your Mac! Simply download and install the app and you will be ready to go.

        On the next few pages, you'll learn more about how to use these features of the application.

        Let's start the learning container

        ```
        docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock learning /bin/bash
        ```

        Once the container starts, we you can move on to the next section.

        We're going to do the following steps inside the learning container.
      steps:

            We can use `docker login`
          id: PEQUOD-demo-login
          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-login
              id: PEQUOD-demo-login-verification
              success-message: "Great job - `docker login` worked"
              failure-message: "Waiting for `docker login`"
        - description: |
            We can use `docker ps`
          id: PEQUOD-demo-ps
          verifications:
            - verification-type: cli-ps
              id: PEQUOD-demo-ps-verification
              success-message: "Great job - `docker ps` worked"
              failure-message: "Waiting for `docker ps`"
        - description: |

            We can use `docker-compose down`
          id: PEQUOD-demo-compose-down
          verifications:
            - verification-type: compose-down
              id: PEQUOD-demo-composedown-verification
