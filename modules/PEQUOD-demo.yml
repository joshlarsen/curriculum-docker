        ## Installing Docker for Mac

        Docker for Mac makes it easy to get started using Docker on your Mac! Simply download and install the app and you will be ready to go.

        On the next few pages, you'll learn more about how to use these features of the application.


        Let's start the learning container

        ```
        docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock learning /bin/bash
        ```

        Once the container starts, we you can move on to the next section.
