# Project 2: Build a Dockerfile for an existing code base

## Walk thru Demo App Architecture
- Add Architectural Diagram with each components
- Examine code FoodTrucks/flask-app/app.py

## Checkout undockerized git branch to start your `FoodTruck` project

* From your terminal window, Use the command line to navigate to the Foodtrucks working directory.

`$ cd ~/sit/Foodtrucks`

* Checkout the GitHub branch called undockerised.

` $ git checkout undockerized `

## Dockerize Web-app

- First, create a `Dockerfile` with your choice of editor, for example:

` vi Dockerfile `

- Add the following items on Dockerfile, instructions for writing docker files, replace your anme and your email for `MAINTAINER`


```

FROM ubuntu:14.04

MAINTAINER Your Name <your email address>

RUN apt-get -yqq update

RUN apt-get -yqq install python-pip python-dev

RUN apt-get -yqq install nodejs npm

RUN ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node


ADD flask-app /opt/flask-app

WORKDIR /opt/flask-app

RUN npm install

RUN npm run build

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 5000

CMD [ "python", "./app.py" ]

```

- Build the docker image for `foodtrucks-web` from the current directory. It will take few minutes for the firs time.

` $ docker build -t foodtrucks-web . ` 

- Check that new docker images are created

` $ docker images `

## Set-up Web app container manually in command line. Learn commands needed to get it up and running correctlyâ€”database container, networking, etc.


- create docker network `foodtrucks`

` $ docker network create foodtrucks ` 

- start the ES container 

` $ docker run -d --net foodtrucks -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 --name es elasticsearch `

- start the flask app container 

` $ docker run -d --net foodtrucks -p 5000:5000 --name foodtrucks-web prakhar1989/foodtrucks-web `

- Verify that two docker containers are started and running 

`$ docker ps -a`

- You should see 2 containers running, elasticsearch and foodtruck-web.

## Start a browser on your laptop and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to perform search.

-  In your browser, go to `localhost:5000`

-  Verify the Foodtruck applicaiton is running correctly, by performing a search for "Tacos" or "Burges" etc, and find location of Foodtrucks. 

-  Navigate maps by scrolling up and down, zooming in and out, and mouse over to a particluar location for more detail informations.
